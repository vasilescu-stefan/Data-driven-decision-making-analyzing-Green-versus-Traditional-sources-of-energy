### Column Descriptions
| Column Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `YEAR` | The calendar year for which the data is provided. |
| `TOTAL ELECTRICITY GENERATION` | The total amount of electricity generated from all sources in the given year, measured in megawatt-hours (MWh). |
| `NUCLEAR GENERATION` | The amount of electricity generated from nuclear power plants in the given year, measured in megawatt-hours (MWh). |
| `NUCLEAR FUEL SHARE` | The percentage of total electricity generation that comes from nuclear power plants in the given year. |
| `CAPACITY FACTOR` | The ratio of the actual electrical energy output of a nuclear power plant over a given period to the maximum possible electrical energy output over that period, expressed as a percentage. It measures the efficiency of the nuclear power plant. |
| `SUMMER CAPACITY` | The maximum rated output of a nuclear power plant during the summer peak demand period, measured in megawatts (MW). This represents the maximum generating capacity of the nuclear power plants in operation during the given year. |
