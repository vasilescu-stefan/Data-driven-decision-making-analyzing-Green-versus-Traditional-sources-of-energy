,"* Conservatively, decommissioning costs are calculated on the basis of 15% LTO overnight costs, assuming  that decommissioning starts 5 years after shutdown and lasts for 10 years as for new build. However, depending on the individual project, some of the incremental decommissioning costs due to LTO have already been included in the LTO overnight costs or are very small. In these cases, incremental decommissioning costs due to LTO will be closer to zero. Provisions for final decommissioning costs have already been accounted for in the cost of electricity produced during the original design lifetime of the plant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
